# [1611. Minimum One Bit Operations to Make Integers Zero](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-one-bit-operations-to-make-integers-zero/description/)  

+ 日期 : 2025/11/08  

## 問題描述  

I don't understand a thing in this problem.  
This is the first day of my weekend. F you LeetCode.  

## 直覺想法  

Software Engineer might not the right job for me.  

## 題解  

```cpp=
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumOneBitOperations(int n) {
        int ans = 0;
        int k = 0;
        int mask = 1;
        
        while (mask <= n) {
            if ((n & mask) != 0) {
                ans = (1 << (k + 1)) - 1 - ans;
            }
            
            mask <<= 1;
            k++;
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
};
```

Time Complexity : $O(log^2n)$  
Space Complexity : $O(logn)$  

## 心得  

I don't even understand the soloution at all bruh.
